Exercise 9:

Tree:
         1
     0   3      6
       7   2    5
       		  4   9
       		  8

This cannot be the result of running weighted quick-union
The height of the tree is 4 which is greater than lg(10) = 3.3
This violates the proposition that depth of any node in a forest built by weighted quick-union for n sites is at most lg(n)
